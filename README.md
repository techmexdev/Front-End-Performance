The Must-Knows about Front End Optomization

# Introduction
As all of us know, there is always something to work on when it comes to optimizing our websites, but some of us might just be spending too much of our time optimizing the *wrong thing*. Less than **twenty percent** of the end user response time is spent getting the HTML page to the web browser. And where does the rest of the time go?

In order to see the real issue, we need to understand what the math is telling us: 
  - **HTML** Downloading the HTML document is usually 5% of the total time. 
  - **Components** Downloading the rest of the components typically counts for 60% of the total time.
  - **Scripts** The remainder of time is spent parsing script tags or css files
